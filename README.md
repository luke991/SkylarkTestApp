# SkylarkTestApp

This is a simple app to display video set content from the Skylark API in a collectionview. The user can also select an edition in this view to see a more detailed view. No additonal steps are required to run the app.

Development was restricted to one day on purpose, so there are some parts that could definitely be further improved.
